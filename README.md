<h3>Literature Quiz App is an exciting mobile application that I've built using the FlutterFlow and Flutter. Firebase acts as the app's backend, providing authentication, database management, and cloud storage.

This app features an intuitive user interface, with a responsive design that works seamlessly across multiple devices. I've incorporated a range of animations and visual effects to make the app more engaging and enjoyable to use.

Developers can also access the app's admin panel to manage the app's content, such as adding or removing writers and questions. Additionally, I've included a level system and leaderboard to track users' progress and encourage social competition.

Users can log in using their email and password or choose to create a guest account. I've also incorporated a dark mode feature that helps reduce eye strain and conserve battery life.

Finally, the app includes AdMob, which displays ads within the app and helps generate revenue for the development team.</h3>
